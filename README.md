# Naive Bayes and KNN classifiers, ML
Construction of classifiers from scratch using KNN and Naive Bayes as algorithms.<br/>
Construction of these classifiers using the same algorithms, but now making use of Scikit-Learn implementations.<br/>
Evaluation and comparison between what was implemented from scratch and what was obtained with Scikit-Learn.<br/>
Learning success is measured through the evaluation of the classifiers on an evaluation set, having gone through a validation stage to obtain optimal hyper-parameters, and making use of cross-validation.<br/>
The detailed explanation of the project is in the lab "knn-bayes-lab".
